## Acknowledgments

Thanks to the amazing teachers over at [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/), their courses have been incredible in teaching
me the skills needed to complete this solo project. The Frontend Developer Career Path has so much content. It is constantly
updated with new challenges and current information. Definitely worth the Pro Membership.

### Supporting Scrimba

Since 2017, we have created over 20 free courses on Scrimba, and we're going to
continue launching free courses. But to pay our bills, we have to charge once
in a while. So if you've ever wanted to "give back" to Scrimba, you can do that by buying
one of our paid courses

- [Become a professional React developer](https://scrimba.com/course/greact)
- [The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive)
- [The Ultimate JavaScript Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gjavascript)

  It would also mean the world to us if you share the courses.

Happy Coding!
